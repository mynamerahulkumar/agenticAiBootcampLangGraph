As a public company, we \\nare required to periodically tell you many specific facts and figures. \\n“Report,” however, implies a greater responsibility. In addition to the mandated data, we \\nbelieve we owe you additional commentary about what you own and how we think. Our goal is \\nto communicate with you in a manner that we would wish you to use if our positions were \\nreversed – that is, if you were Berkshire’s CEO while I and my family were passive investors, \\ntrusting you with our savings. \\nThis approach leads us to an annual recitation of both good and bad developments at the \\nmany businesses you indirectly own through your Berkshire shares. When discussing problems \\nat specific subsidiaries, we do, however, try to follow the advice Tom Murphy gave to me 60 \\nyears ago: “praise by name, criticize by category.” \\nMistakes – Yes, We Make Them at Berkshire \\nSometimes I’ve made mistakes in assessing the future economics of a business I’ve \\npurchased for Berkshire – each a case of capital allocation gone wrong. That happens with both \\njudgments about marketable equities – we view these as partial ownership of businesses – and \\nthe 100% acquisitions of companies. \\nAt other times, I’ve made mistakes when assessing the abilities or fidelity of the \\nmanagers Berkshire is hiring. The fidelity disappointments can hurt beyond their financial \\nimpact, a pain that can approach that of a failed marriage. \\nA decent batting average in personnel decisions is all that can be hoped for. The cardinal \\nsin is delaying the correction of mistakes or what Charlie Munger called “thumb-sucking.” \\nProblems, he would tell me, cannot be wished away. They require action, however \\nuncomfortable that may be. \\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \\nDuring the 2019-23 period, I have used the words “mistake” or “error” 16 times in my \\nletters to you. Many other huge companies have never used either word over that span. Amazon, \\nI should acknowledge, made some brutally candid observations in its 2021 letter. Elsewhere, it \\nhas generally been happy talk and pictures. \\n1'),\n",

Pete \\ndied in November, still working at 80. \\nI first heard of Forest River – the Indiana company Pete founded and managed – on \\nJune 21, 2005. On that day I received a letter from an intermediary detailing relevant data about \\nthe company, a recreational vehicle (“RV”) manufacturer. The writer said that Pete, the 100% \\nowner of Forest River, specifically wanted to sell to Berkshire. He also told me the price that Pete \\nexpected to receive. I liked this no-nonsense approach. \\nI did some checking with RV dealers, liked what I learned and arranged a June 28th \\nmeeting in Omaha. Pete brought along his wife, Sharon, and daughter, Lisa. When we met, Pete \\nassured me that he wanted to keep running the business but would feel more comfortable if he \\ncould assure financial security for his family. \\nPete next mentioned that he owned some real estate that was leased to Forest River and \\nhad not been covered in the June 21 letter. Within a few minutes, we arrived at a price for those \\nassets as I expressed no need for appraisal by Berkshire but would simply accept his valuation. \\nThen we arrived at the other point that needed clarity. I asked Pete what his compensation \\nshould be, adding that whatever he said, I would accept. (This, I should add, is not an approach I \\nrecommend for general use.) \\nPete paused as his wife, daughter and I leaned forward. Then he surprised us: “Well, I \\nlooked at Berkshire’s proxy statement and I wouldn’t want to make more than my boss, so pay \\nme $100,000 per year.” After I picked myself off the floor, Pete added: “But we will earn X (he \\nnamed a number) this year, and I would like an annual bonus of 10% of any earnings above what \\nthe company is now delivering.” I replied: “OK Pete, but if Forest River makes any significant \\nacquisitions we will make an appropriate adjustment for the additional capital thus employed.” I \\ndidn’t define “appropriate” or “significant,” but those vague terms never caused a problem. \\n2'),\n",

We were aided by a predictable large gain in \\ninvestment income as Treasury Bill yields improved and we substantially increased our holdings \\nof these highly-liquid short-term securities. \\nOur insurance business also delivered a major increase in earnings, led by the \\nperformance of GEICO. In five years, Todd Combs has reshaped GEICO in a major way, \\nincreasing efficiency and bringing underwriting practices up to date.

Someday, any day, a \\ntruly staggering insurance loss will occur – and there is no guarantee that there will be only one \\nper annum. \\nThe P/C business is so central to Berkshire that it warrants a further discussion that \\nappears later in this letter. \\nBerkshire’s railroad and utility operations, our two largest businesses outside of \\ninsurance, improved their aggregate earnings. Both, however, have much left to accomplish. \\nLate in the year we increased our ownership of the utility operation from about 92% to \\n100% at a cost of roughly $3.9 billion, of which $2.9 billion was paid in cash with a balance in \\nBerkshire “B” shares. \\n* * * * * * * * * * * * \\nAll told, we recorded operating earnings of $47.4 billion in 2024.

Many of these companies earn very high returns on the net tangible equity required for \\ntheir operations. At yearend, our partial-ownership holdings were valued at $272 billion. \\nUnderstandably, really outstanding businesses are very seldom offered in their entirety, but small \\nfractions of these gems can be purchased Monday through Friday on Wall Street and, very \\noccasionally, they sell at bargain prices. \\nWe are impartial in our choice of equity vehicles, investing in either variety based upon \\nwhere we can best deploy your (and my family’s) savings.

Additionally, with ownership of minority positions we can’t change management if \\nthat action is needed or control what is done with capital flows if we are unhappy with the \\ndecisions being made. \\nWith controlled companies, we can dictate these decisions, but we have far less flexibility \\nin the disposition of mistakes.

Finally, we have outstanding managers \\n(no optimists) and are particularly well-situated to utilize the substantial sums P/C insurance \\ndelivers for investment. \\nOver the past two decades, our insurance business has generated $32 billion of after-tax \\nprofits from underwriting, about 3.3 cents per dollar of sales after income tax. Meanwhile, our \\nfloat has grown from $46 billion to $171 billion. The float is likely to grow a bit over time and, \\nwith intelligent underwriting (and some luck), has a reasonable prospect of being costless. \\nBerkshire Increases its Japanese Investments \\nA small but important exception to our U.S.-based focus is our growing investment in \\nJapan. \\nIt’s been almost six years since Berkshire began purchasing shares in five Japanese \\ncompanies that very successfully operate in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself. The \\nfive are (alphabetically) ITOCHU, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui and Sumitomo. Each of these \\nlarge enterprises, in turn, owns interests in a vast array of businesses, many based in Japan but \\nothers that operate throughout the world. \\n10'),\n",

We simply looked at \\ntheir financial records and were amazed at the low prices of their stocks. As the years have \\npassed, our admiration for these companies has consistently grown. Greg has met many times \\nwith them, and I regularly follow their progress. Both of us like their capital deployment, their \\nmanagements and their attitude in respect to their investors. \\nEach of the five companies increase dividends when appropriate, they repurchase their \\nshares when it is sensible to do so, and their top managers are far less aggressive in their \\ncompensation programs than their U.S. counterparts. \\nOur holdings of the five are for the very long term, and we are committed to supporting \\ntheir boards of directors. From the start, we also agreed to keep Berkshire’s holdings below 10% \\nof each company’s shares. But, as we approached this limit, the five companies agreed to \\nmoderately relax the ceiling. Over time, you will likely see Berkshire’s ownership of all five \\nincrease somewhat. \\nAt yearend, Berkshire’s aggregate cost (in dollars) was $13.8 billion and the market value \\nof our holdings totaled $23.5 billion. \\nMeanwhile, Berkshire has consistently – but not pursuant to any formula – increased its \\nyen-denominated borrowings. All are at fixed rates, no “floaters.” Greg and I have no view on \\nfuture foreign exchange rates and therefore seek a position approximating currency-neutrality. \\nWe are required, however, under GAAP rules to regularly recognize in our earnings a calculation \\nof any gains or losses in the yen we have borrowed and, at yearend, had included $2.3 billion of \\nafter-tax gains due to dollar strength of which $850 million occurred in 2024. \\nI expect that Greg and his eventual successors will be holding this Japanese position for \\nmany decades and that Berkshire will find other ways to work productively with the five \\ncompanies in the future. \\nWe like the current math of our yen-balanced strategy as well. As I write this, the annual \\ndividend income expected from the Japanese investments in 2025 will total about $812 million \\nand the interest cost of our yen-denominated debt will be about $135 million. \\nThe Annual Gathering in Omaha \\nI hope you will join us in Omaha on May 3rd. We are following a somewhat changed \\nschedule this year, but the basics remain the same. Our goal is that you get many of your \\nquestions answered, that you connect with friends, and that you leave with a good impression of \\nOmaha. The city looks forward to your visits. \\n11'),\n",

But each \\nsummer, the Berkshire office force gets together to watch the Omaha Storm Chasers play \\nbaseball against a Triple A opponent. I ask a few alums to join us, and Carrie usually comes with \\nher family. At this year’s event, I brazenly asked her if she would do a 60th Anniversary issue, \\nfeaturing Charlie’s photos, quotes and stories that have seldom been made public. \\nEven with three young children to manage, Carrie immediately said “yes.” Consequently, \\nwe will have 5,000 copies of the new book available for sale on Friday afternoon and from \\n7 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday. \\nCarrie refused any payment for her extensive work on the new “Charlie” edition. I \\nsuggested she and I co-sign 20 copies to be given to any shareholder contributing $5,000 to the \\nStephen Center that serves homeless adults and children in South Omaha.
