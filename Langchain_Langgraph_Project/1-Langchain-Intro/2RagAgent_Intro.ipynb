A GPU is a hardware component originally designed for a specific purpose: to render and display images, videos, and animations. Now, they are used in a wider range of applications, including creative production. machine learning, and artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia has continued to deliver leading-edge graphics developments through its groundbreaking GPU efforts.\\n\\n\\n Currently, Nvidia’s greatest source of revenue is its Compute and Networking business segment, which includes artificial intelligence (AI). The company has become a full-stack (from front-end to back-end) computing infrastructure company that is reshaping a diverse range of complex computing processes.\\n\\n\\n In addition to the GPUs that Nvidia designs and manufactures for gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and other professional applications, the company also creates chip systems for use in vehicles, robotics, and other tools.\\n\\n\\n Key Takeaways\\nNvidia introduced and innovated the graphics processing unit (GPU), which is a key component of PC architecture and large-scale applications.Nvidia designs and sells GPUs for gaming, cryptocurrency mining, and professional applications; the company also sells chip systems for use in vehicles, robotics, and more.Nvidia’s Compute and Networking business segment, which includes artificial intelligence (AI), is the company’s biggest revenue generator.The Graphics business segment is Nvidia’s second-largest revenue generator.\\n\\n  Nvidia’s Industry  \\n Nvidia is a leading company in the semiconductor industry and is part of the greater information technology sector.\\n\\n\\n The company’s goal is to offer technology solutions for increasingly complex computational challenges. AI has been a major focus for years, and this focus has intensified in recent years as AI technology has made significant developments—and public interest in the potential uses and impact of AI has grown.\\n\\n\\n According to its 10-K filing, Nvidia believes that the market for its products faces intense technological change and changing industry standards.\\n\\n\\n It is also an extremely competitive market, where performance, product offerings, and access to customers, partners, and distribution channels are critical factors. Other key issues it must address are software support, the ability to conform to industry standard application programming interfaces (APIs), manufacturing strengths, processor pricing, and total costs.\\n\\n\\n  Competitors  \\n It has a variety of competitors in different areas of the industry. Some of them are hardware and software suppliers and licensors, such as Intel Corp. (INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Huawei.\\n\\n\\n Cloud services companies also engaged in designing AI computing functionality—including Alibaba Group (BABA), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Amazon Inc. (AMZN), and Microsoft (MSFT)—are also major competitors.\\n\\n\\n  Nvidia’s Financials  \\n As of April 2025, Nvidia’s market capitalization was $2.3 trillion.\\n\\n\\n In February 2025, Nvidia announced its financial results for the 2025 fiscal year (FY) and the fourth quarter (Q4) of the 2025 FY, the three-month period ended Jan. 26, 2025.
